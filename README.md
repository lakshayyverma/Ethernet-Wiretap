The objective of this project is to create an Ethernet Wiretap that can be installed between two switches or between a switch and a router to intercept data packets passing through them. The wiretap can also be used to create a .pcap file of the captured data and send it to a command and control server.
The ethernet wiretap must remain undetected by security devices such as Network Access Control (NAC). It must avoid raising suspicious alerts from security systems, allowing stealthy monitoring of network traffic. The wiretap must be small and unobtrusive, ensuring that it can be easily concealed within the network infrastructure. The compact size of the wiretap is essential to minimize the risk of being detected by network administration or other employees.
This project caters to the needs of penetration testers, who evaluate network security and find potential vulnerabilities. The network traffic collected by the wiretap allows penetration testers to obtain invaluable insights into the protocols used for communication, information of devices in the network and data transmitted within the network. The wiretap assess the effectiveness of security controls such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems.
